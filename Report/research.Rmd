# Chapter 4: My Research

The following are the insights I obtained when doing this study project, that were worth mentioning.

## Causal Inference

Correlation between Win% of a team and a team’s number of passes does **not** necessarily imply that passing more during games will lead to higher Win%. The same goes to other parameters such as possession percentage, passing accuracy, etc.

The best approach to identify effective parameters would be to use causality tests, and hence obtain true causes of improved performance for a team/player. These effective parameters may vary from team to team, as each team differs in its ambitions and style of play.

## Economics

When analyzing the cost of buying a player, economic principles such as correcting values for inflation and opportunity cost analysis may be used. This will give a more holistic understanding of whether or not a player is worth buying.

A point to note is that the inflation within the football transfer market has been much higher than the consumer sector. Players that would’ve cost around $€ 30M$ few years ago now cost around $€ 80M$. This is due to large transfers made by big clubs for players, such as *Neymar Jr.* in 2017 - costing Paris Saint-Germain around $€ 222M$. Moreover, there has been a sudden influx of investments in the footballing world, thereby resulting in clubs demanding higher transfer fees to sell their players.

## Implementation

A basic implementation was performed to learn using Python for statistical computing. The codes are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AhmedThahir/StudyProject#implementations) for this project.

### English Premier League Predictor

This implementation tries to predict the 2nd half win% of a team using data from the first half of the season. Using Pythagorean Expectation gave better results, as the correlation and $R^2$ value was higher. Referred to @FoundationsSportsAnalytics

### FIFA21 Player Rating

This implementation aims at predicting players’ FIFA21 (an official football game) rating using their market value. An attempt at including the effect of inflation using CPI failed. Referred to @chazan-pantzalisSportsAnalyticsAlgorithms2020

- Only CPI is not enough to include the hyper inflation in football. CPI only shows an inflation of around 5%; hyper-inflation is much higher than that. Hence, getting the deviation from the average transfer value of each year may provide a better result.
- Relationship is only satisfied for players with value $\ge 1M$. This **could** mean that there are many good under-valued players.
- Corrected Degree 3&4 Regression gave the best-fit. However, due to over-fitting, it has a downward slope at the end; hence, it is to be rejected.

### Granger Causality test of Cristiano Ronaldo's Market Value, Performance, and Age

Hypothesis: Market Value is a function of previous year's performance and age.

$$
\begin{aligned}
V &\propto P \\
V & \propto \frac{1}{A} \\
V &= a V_{t-1} + b x_{t-1} \\
x &= \text{Goals} + \text{Assists} - \text{Age}
\end{aligned}
$$

The base/'zero' value of every player must be their initial value, as every player starts off from a different initial value. This is not just restricted to talent/skill, due to factors such as nationality. Moreover, it helps accommodate the market value of a player who started off with a high value won't really go $< 1M$.
