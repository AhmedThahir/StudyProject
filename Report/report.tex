\abstract{
Sports analytics is a field of study involved in understanding and improving sports performance of team(s) and player(s), using relevant data. It has been found that current research in Sports Analytics primarily focuses on prediction using statistical correlation, rather than making decisions using causation. My research proposes using causal inference to identify parameters that can improve a team/players' performance. Moreover, the idea of using economics principles for financial decisions such as player transfers has also been introduced here. Furthermore, a basic use-case of Granger Causality has also been implemented.

  \caption{Types of Prediction Models}
\end{table}

Consider \(h(x)\) to be hypothesis function (prediction). The following are the most commonly-used prediction models.

\hypertarget{linear-regression}{%
\subsubsection{Linear Regression}\label{linear-regression}}

A value prediction algorithm, which finds a best-fit straight line for the data.
\[
h(x) = a_0 + a_1 x
\]

\hypertarget{polynomial-regression}{%
\subsubsection{Polynomial Regression}\label{polynomial-regression}}

A value prediction algorithm, which finds a best-fit curve for the data.
\[
h(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n
\]

\hypertarget{logistic-regression}{%
\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}\label{logistic-regression}}

A classification algorithm, which finds a best-fit line to separate 2 categories of data. It incorporates a \emph{Sigmoid Function} \(g(z)\) that maps the output range as \([0, 1]\).
\[
\begin{aligned}
h(x) &= g(a_0 + a_1 x) \\
g(z) &= \frac1{ 1+e^{-z} }
\end{aligned}
\]

\hypertarget{decision-tree}{%
\subsubsection{Decision Tree}\label{decision-tree}}

A classification and value prediction algorithm that contains a tree-like structure of nodes, with conditions in each of them. It is very useful for conditional problems.

\hypertarget{random-forests}{%
\subsubsection{Random Forests}\label{random-forests}}

A classification and value prediction algorithm that contains a collection of decision trees. The final output is an averaged output of the trees.

\hypertarget{supported-vector-machines}{%
\subsubsection{Supported Vector Machines}\label{supported-vector-machines}}

A classification algorithm that tries to find a \emph{hyperplane}, that tries to maximize the margin between different categories of data.

\hypertarget{rubins-causal-model}{%
\subsection{Rubin's Causal Model}\label{rubins-causal-model}}

A model for causal inference, that depends on randomized testing to derive causality. It is widely used for deriving the effectiveness of treatments and drugs. Using a correct randomized experiment, the correlation obtained is equal to causal effect of the input.

`Treatment' refers to applying the input (1), and `no treatment' refers to not applying the input (0). Outcomes are the output with/without the treatment.

The average treatment effect - the true causal effect of an input - is the difference between the average outcome with and without the treatment. Averaging improves accuracy, as the input is a random variable.

However, as it depends on experimentation and the input can only be binary - 0/1, it is not always feasible. The preferred causal inference model is Judea-Pearl model which derives causality from observational data.

\hypertarget{gini-coeffiecent}{%
\subsection{Gini Coeffiecent}\label{gini-coeffiecent}}

Quantifies disparities/inequality in a distribution. It is mainly used for quantifying income disparities of various locations, communities, etc.

\[
\begin{aligned}
G
&=\frac{2}{n^{2} \bar{x}} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} i\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right) \\
&=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(2 i-n-1) x_{i}}{n \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}
\end{aligned}
\]

\hypertarget{hypothesis-testing}{%
\subsection{Hypothesis Testing}\label{hypothesis-testing}}

A statistical tool involving a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis to determine validity of a hypothesis.

\hypertarget{p-value}{%
\subsubsection{p-Value}\label{p-value}}

It is the probability of the null hypothesis being true.

\hypertarget{statistical-significance}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical Significance}\label{statistical-significance}}

A statistical test is said to be significant, if it has a p-Value of \(p \le 0.05\).

\hypertarget{granger-causality}{%
\subsection{Granger Causality}\label{granger-causality}}

A model to determine if one time series affects another. It helps determine direction of causality, when there is a 2-way correlation. The past values of \(x\) are tested to determine if they have a statistically significant effect on the current value of \(y\), taking past values of \(x\) as regressors. However, it may \textbf{not always} give true causality.

\[
y_t = a + b y_{t-1} + c x_{t-1}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if \(c \ne 0\) , then \(x\) \textbf{granger causes} \(y\)
\item
  \(t\) and \(t-1\) are not necessarily years; it just denotes a time period
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{current-research}{%
\subsection{Current Research}\label{current-research}}

The main reference paper for my research is . It provided a comprehensive explanation of Sports Analytics.

Sports data can be in different forms - qualitative/quantitative or structured/unstructured. This data could include player actions, spatio-temporal data, biographical data, scouting reports, etc. Sports analytics involves collecting and analyzing this data in order to gain insights. \protect\hyperlink{ref-bhatnagarSystematicReviewSports2019}{{[}6{]}}

\protect\hyperlink{ref-dixonModellingAssociationFootball1997}{{[}7{]}} predicted the winner of a game, using a Poisson Distribution to predict the goals scored by each team. \protect\hyperlink{ref-maoIdentifyingKeysWin2016}{{[}8{]}} created a model to predict match outcome, using logistic regression. \protect\hyperlink{ref-kampakisUsingTwitterPredict}{{[}9{]}} used numerous machine learning algorithms on n-grams (a specific sequence of letters/words) to predict match outcomes. \protect\hyperlink{ref-broichStatisticalAnalysisFirst2014}{{[}10{]}} concluded that that shot efficiency is more important than the number of shots; number of passes and ball contacts are also important factors; the distance covered was not found to be important. \protect\hyperlink{ref-ruiz-ruizAnalysisEntriesPenalty2013}{{[}11{]}} analyzed the 2006 World Cup and found that winning teams enter the opponent's penalty area more often. \protect\hyperlink{ref-ruiz-ruizAnalysisEntriesPenalty2013}{{[}11{]}} analyzed the 2006 World Cup and found that winning teams hardly allowed opponents enter their penalty area.

\protect\hyperlink{ref-armatasEVALUATIONGOALSSCORED2009}{{[}12{]}} found that there are more second half goals than in the first half; moreover, the probability of scoring increases with time. \protect\hyperlink{ref-DIFFERENCESOFFENSIVEACTIONS}{{[}13{]}} found that top teams are more efficient and score more goals from within the penalty area, inferred to be due to tactical superiority; another differentiator between top teams and other teams is the number of key passes (passes that lead to a goal scoring opportunity). \protect\hyperlink{ref-evangelosWinnersLosersTop}{{[}14{]}} compared one-sided games with competitive ones; they found that one-sided winners had much better possession \%, ``one-v-one'' duels, number of passes, shots, shots on target, and shooting accuracy; but these were inapplicable close range games. \protect\hyperlink{ref-hughesAnalysisPassingSequences2005}{{[}15{]}} analyzed two different FIFA World Cups and found that were more goals scored from passing sequences that were longer rather than shorter; however, when the number of passes gets too large, more attempts were required to score a goal.

\protect\hyperlink{ref-chazan-pantzalisSportsAnalyticsAlgorithms2020}{{[}2{]}} created a binary classification model to predict how each team of various European Leagues would perform, using numerous parameters such as previous year position, wins, draws, losses, net transfer expenditure, etc. Moreover, it focused on player performance prediction, with a focus on central defenders. Various features such as passing, heading, aggression were obtained from the game \emph{Football Manager}. These were used to predict match rating of players. The best predictors were found to be interceptions, clearances, jumping reach and strength.

Finally, \protect\hyperlink{ref-dobsonPerformanceRevenueProfessional1998}{{[}16{]}} took a different approach. It performed a \emph{Granger causality test} to find that ``the influence of lagged revenue on current performance is greater than the influence of lagged performance on current revenue''. However, despite this research highlighting some form of causality, trying to improve performance through increasing revenue isn't feasible, as it is not an easily controllable parameter.

\hypertarget{gaps}{%
\subsection{Gaps}\label{gaps}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Current research mainly focuses on prediction
\item
  Over-reliance on correlation

  Correlation is useful for making predictions, but is insufficient for making effective decisions
\item
  Lack of causal inference

  Decisions without casual understanding may prove to be costly, as they may \textbf{not produce} efficient outcomes
\item
  Financial values are in absolute terms, rather than relative terms

  This is not accurate, as \(€ 50\rm{M}\) was much more valuable 10 years ago compared to present-day, due to inflation.

\section{Chapter 4: My Research}\label{chapter-4-my-research}}

The following are the insights I obtained when doing this study project, that were worth mentioning.

\hypertarget{causal-inference}{%
\subsection{Causal Inference}\label{causal-inference}}

Correlation between Win\% of a team and a team's number of passes does \textbf{not} necessarily imply that passing more during games will lead to higher Win\%. The same goes to other parameters such as possession percentage, passing accuracy, etc.

The best approach to identify effective parameters would be to use causality tests, and hence obtain true causes of improved performance for a team/player. These effective parameters may vary from team to team, as each team differs in its ambitions and style of play.

\hypertarget{economics}{%
\subsection{Economics}\label{economics}}

When analyzing the cost of buying a player, economic principles such as correcting values for inflation and opportunity cost analysis may be used. This will give a more holistic understanding of whether or not a player is worth buying.

A point to note is that the inflation within the football transfer market has been much higher than the consumer sector. Players that would've cost around \(€ 30M\) few years ago now cost around \(€ 80M\). This is due to large transfers made by big clubs for players, such as \emph{Neymar Jr.} in 2017 - costing Paris Saint-Germain around \(€ 222M\). Moreover, there has been a sudden influx of investments in the footballing world, thereby resulting in clubs demanding higher transfer fees to sell their players.

\hypertarget{implementation-1}{%
\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation-1}}

A basic implementation was performed to learn using Python for statistical computing. The codes are available on the \href{https://github.com/AhmedThahir/StudyProject\#implementations}{GitHub repository} for this project.

\hypertarget{english-premier-league-predictor}{%
\subsubsection{English Premier League Predictor}\label{english-premier-league-predictor}}

This implementation tries to predict the 2nd half win\% of a team using data from the first half of the season. Using Pythagorean Expectation gave better results, as the correlation and \(R^2\) value was higher. Referred to \protect\hyperlink{ref-FoundationsSportsAnalytics}{{[}4{]}}

This implementation aims at predicting players' FIFA21 (an official football game) rating using their market value. An attempt at including the effect of inflation using CPI failed. Referred to \protect\hyperlink{ref-chazan-pantzalisSportsAnalyticsAlgorithms2020}{{[}2{]}}

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Only CPI is not enough to include the hyper inflation in football. CPI only shows an inflation of around 5\%; hyper-inflation is much higher than that. Hence, getting the deviation from the average transfer value of each year may provide a better result.
\item
  Relationship is only satisfied for players with value \(\ge 1M\). This \textbf{could} mean that there are many good under-valued players.
\item
  Corrected Degree 3\&4 Regression gave the best-fit. However, due to over-fitting, it has a downward slope at the end; hence, it is to be rejected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{granger-causality-test-of-cristiano-ronaldos-market-value-performance-and-age}{%
\subsubsection{Granger Causality test of Cristiano Ronaldo's Market Value, Performance, and Age}\label{granger-causality-test-of-cristiano-ronaldos-market-value-performance-and-age}}

Hypothesis: Market Value is a function of previous year's performance and age.

\[
\begin{aligned}
V &\propto P \\
V & \propto \frac{1}{A} \\
V &= a V_{t-1} + b x_{t-1} \\
x &= \text{Goals} + \text{Assists} - \text{Age}
\end{aligned}
\]

The base/`zero' value of every player must be their initial value, as every player starts off from a different initial value. This is not just restricted to talent/skill, due to factors such as nationality. Moreover, it helps accommodate the market value of a player who started off with a high value won't really go \(< 1M\).
