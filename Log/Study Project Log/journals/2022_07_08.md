- [The Paradox of Choice](https://youtu.be/VO6XEQIsCoM)
	- The more choices available,
		- Pros
			- More freedom
			- Expression of Individuality
		- Cons
			- Lower satisfaction
			- Easy to constantly imagine and regret what you didn't buy could have been better
			- Higher opportunity cost
			- Expectations get higher
			- When your purchase is bad but there is only one option, you can blame the world; but when there are so many options, you can only blame yourself for getting it wrong
		- Causing higher depression and suicide rates
	- The reason why everything was better when everything was worse, it's because it was actually possible for to have a pleasant surprise
	- The secret to happiness is low expectations #Happiness
	- Some choice is better than none, but more choice is not better than some choice
	- Pareto Improving Move - If some choices were shifted to societies where they have no choice, everyone would be better off
