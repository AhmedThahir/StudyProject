	- > If you understand your solution better than the problem, then you are doing something wrong.
	- try to use simple models, whenever possible
		- they are easier to understand, maintain, debug, and explain to managers

	  collapsed:: true
		- don't just do A-B testing to test the effectiveness of the recommender
		- do A-random testing to see how many people use the recommendation regardless of whether it's good or bad
