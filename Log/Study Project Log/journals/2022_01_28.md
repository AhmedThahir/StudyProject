	  2. Arrange them in chronological order. There should be a relation between the papers that you take.
	  3. Start finding the problem statement of the paper (X1) taken in 2018. Find out the issue/concern in the paper. Identify a paper published later to this say (X2). The paper X2 should have resolved some issues of paper X1. Identify a paper published later to this say (X3). The paper X3 should have resolved some issues of paper X2. Hope you understand what I am saying: There should be a relationship between the papers that you ordered as per chronological order.
