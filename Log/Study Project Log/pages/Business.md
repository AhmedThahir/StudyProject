	- ## Iron Law of Marketing
		- The market doesn't care how smart you are
		- It wants what it wants
	- Prototyping and experimentation
		- helps understand weaknesses
		- Build a minimum economically-viable offer which is feasible to produce but also convincing for customers
		- Improve it over time
	- ## Cognitive Bias
		- Absence Blindness
			- We are not tuned to see what is not there
	- ## Communication Overhead
	- ## Systems
		- View every operation as part of a system
		- Aim for amplification(multiplied efficiency) more than accumulation (added efficiency)
		- Allows to perform scenario planning
		- Invest in resilience and backup solutions **before starting**
