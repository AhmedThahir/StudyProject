- Struggling with anxiety
	- i'm really disappointed that i haven't made much progress, but it's been a very hard time
	- I've been finding it hard to focus
- So i'm just gonna start with baby steps
- For today, i'm just gonna summarize whatever i've done so far in the past 2 months
	- I started Intro to Sports Analytics by University of Michigan
	- Maybe i could look from a statistical and econometric perspective, rather than strictly machine learning prediction
		- Hence, I started an econometric data analysis course on youtube
		- I feel like causal analysis/inference has not been implemented much in sports
	- Also, I feel like I could do my implementation using Julia, due to improved performance
