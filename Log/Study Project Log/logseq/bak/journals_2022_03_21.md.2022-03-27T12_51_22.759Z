- made a basic implementation
- didn't quite work out
- met [[Sartaj]]
	- The relationship is 2 way
		- $O = f(V); V = g(O)$
		- Granger Causality Test
	- to use current method
collapsed:: true
		- use average of market value and ratings
		- use regular OLS
	- to use current dataset
collapsed:: true

				- time (2017, 2018, ...)
				- space (players)
			- so we cannot use regular OLS here
