- Watched a video showing the benefits of vectorized operations using `numpy` instead of manual iterative statements
- Rating Predictor Fixes
	- DONE Only use fifa 22 dataset
	- CANCELED Use scikit learn split dataset
	- DONE Rating Rounding #fix
		- ```python
		  np.around(prediction)
		  
		  # prediction = ( round(element) for element in prediction )
		  ```
	- DONE Regression Output Range #fix
		- Do this second, so that there is less searching for numpy
		- ```python
		  np.where( prediction>100, 100 )
		  # prediction = min(100, data)
		  ```
- Idea for another paper
