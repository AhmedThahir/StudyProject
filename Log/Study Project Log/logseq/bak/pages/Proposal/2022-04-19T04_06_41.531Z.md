	- ## Gaps
	  collapsed:: true
		- most of these papers talk about prediction, but not much on helping making informed decisions
		- statistics: i believe that current researches focus more on correlation rather than causation
		  collapsed:: true
			- football example
			  collapsed:: true
				- just because win% has high correlation with no of passes, doesn't mean that we have to increase it to win more
				- it could just be that winning teams pass more and not the other way around
				  collapsed:: true
					- for eg, if a team is winning by 3 goals, then obviously it will just pass the ball around to waste time
			- basketball example
			  collapsed:: true
				- just cuz 3 point accuracy for a random basketball player is 30% doesn't mean that a new player should adopt that
				- what if the reason the accuracy is that way is cuz only the good shooters take those shots
		- economics: i believe an economics perspective will help a lot
		  collapsed:: true
			- ==opportunity cost== of decision A over B
			- for example, in market value and the business side, the data that is available online is the absolute data, not the **real data**
			  collapsed:: true
			  real data means in relative terms; for example,
				- **Nominal income** = monetary income
				- **Real income** reflects the quantity of goods and services you can buy
				  $\frac{\text{nominal income}}{\text{average of prices of all goods and services bought}}$
- # Objective of my Research
  collapsed:: true
	- ![analysis.png](../assets/analysis_1650024180461_0.png){:height 417, :width 603}
	- understand what a manager should devote their resources for and what not to do
	- causal analysis and econometrics
	  collapsed:: true
		- causal analysis
		  collapsed:: true
			- $E \big [y |\text{do}(x = a) \big]$ instead of $E \big [y |(x = a) \big]$
		- Economics - Sartaj sir
		- statistics - maneesha ma'am
	- choice of sport - football
	  collapsed:: true
		- basketball is a high scoring game, so accuracy of prediction will be greater??
		- but football > basketball?
		  collapsed:: true
			- global sport
			- more accessible data
			- larger scope; basketball is mainly popular cuz of NBA
	- test on current data and predict for upcoming world cup
	- analyze causally what is the most important factors
